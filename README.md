## Methodology

The application utilizes modularization by separating the GitHub API call and generation of the markdown into separate modules: `api.js` and `generateMarkdown.js`.

The application also utilizes, as much as possible, syntax and paradigms including:

- Arrow functions, 
- `const`, `let`, 
- Template literals
